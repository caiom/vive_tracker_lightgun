# Vive Tracker Lightgun

Check these [instructions](https://github.com/n1ckfg/ViveTrackerExample) for running SteamVR without a head set


Set vive tracker as a left hand controller and change
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR\drivers\htc\resources\input\tracker\legacy_bindings_vive_tracker_handed_rotated.json"
to remove "Roll" from strings.
